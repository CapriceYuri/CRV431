        <br><div class="art-header">Potential of Rencofilstat for Multiple Myeloma ["MM"]</div>
        <div class="art-content"><br> This study of Rencofilstat in Pre-Clinical MM has shown anti-cancer activity. In combination with bortezomib, a proteosome inhibitor, they produced 100% cytotoxicity across all 16 MM cell lines. This includes three cell lines that were characterized as bortezomib-resistant.<br><br>Bortezomib is a medication drug used to treat people with multiple myeloma, a type of cancer of the bone marrow.<br><br>The experiments were performed by Diag2Tec in Montepllier, France.

        <br><div class="art-header">Anti-Cancer Activity of Rencofilstat with Proteosome Inhibitors</div>
        <div class="art-content"><br> Findings from a pre-clinical study suggest that Rencofilstat with a proteasome inhibitor, ixazomib, can increase proteotoxic stress in prostate cancer. Proteosome inhibitors are a class of anti-cancer agents, used for the treatment of multiple myeloma and other blood cancers. They kill cancer cells by inducing a process called proteotoxic stress. Both drugs alone at low concentrations weren't able to cause proteotoxic stress or kill the cancer cells. However, in combination, they produced proteotoxic stress and killed 70%-90% of the cancer cells in 4 different cell lines in a period of two days.<br><br>It is also worth mention, the drug combination caused only mild, temporary stress, and no killing on non-cancer cells.<br><br>This preclinical study findings were contributed by Carlos Perez-Stable, PhD, from the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and Miami Veterans Affairs/Research. <br><br> Link for full story: <a class="link" href="https://hepionpharma.com/news/presentation-of-preclinical-study-highlighting-anti-cancer-activity-of-rencofilstat-in-combination-with-proteosome-inhibitors/" target="_blank">Click Here</a></div><br>

        <br><div class="art-header">Food Effect and Rencofilstat</div>
        <div class="art-content"><br>In a open-label trial, it is concluded that Rencofilstat can safely be taken with or without food. Matter of fact, high fat meal increases the absorption of Rencofilstat. The increased absorption did not cause toxicity, and it is possible the increased exposure could enchance the efficacy of Rencofilstat in NASH and/or HCC for patients who may be identified as poor absorbers. <br><br> Link for full story: <a class="link" href="https://accp1.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpdd.1179" target="_blank">Click Here</a></div><br>

        <br><div class="art-header">Anti-Tumor Activity of Rencofilstat with an Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor</div>
        <div class="art-content"><br>The study investigates the synergy of Rencofilstat and anti-PD1. This nonclinical cancer study found that the synergy of the drugs were able to greatly altered the the developement tumors in mouse models. The combination treatment were able to decreased tumor size up to 69% and increased median mouse survival time by 26% after 28 days. Which was not demonstrated when Rencofilstat and anti-PD1 adminstrated alone.<br>Both Rencofilstat and anti-PD1 shown immunity against the tumors but Rencofilstat decreased the number of neutrophils in the tumors as well, which was not observed with anti-PD1. Neutrophil mediates inflammation which promotes tumor growth, therefore, the reduction demonstrated by Rencofilstat provides additional anti-tumor effect.  <br><br> Links for full story: <a class="link" href="https://hepionpharma.com/news/hepion-pharmaceuticals-rencofilstat-in-combination-with-an-immune-checkpoint-inhibitor-demonstrates-synergistic-anti-tumor-activity-in-a-nonclinical-liver-cancer-study/" target="_blank">Click Here </a><a class="link" href="https://hepionpharma.com/news/hepion-pharmaceuticals-and-fibrofind-announce-anti-cancer-activity-of-crv431-in-a-nonclinical-liver-cancer-study/" target="_blank">Click Here</a></div><br>

        <br><div class="art-header">Anti-PD1 and Rencofilstat, in fatty liver mode of HCC</div>
        <div class="poster">Poster / Abstract</div>
        <div class="art-content"><br>Cyclophilin have shown in preclinical studies to contribute to progression of HCC and other type of cancer. The study concludes that as monotherapy, Rencofilstat shows anti-tumor effects on normal liver background. As for fatty liver background which is resistant to monotherapy, rencofilstat synergized with anti-PD1 was able to achieved anti-tumor effects. <br><br> Link for full story: <a class="link" href="https://www.postersessiononline.eu/173580348_eu/congresos/ILC2022/aula/-FRI_590_ILC2022.pdf" target="_blank">Click Here</a></div><br>

        <div class="poster">Poster / Abstract</div>
        <div class="art-content"><br>By targeting Cyclophilin-A, Rencofilstat have demonstrated anti-viral activity against HIV, HBV, and HCV by disrupting the interactions between Cyclophilin-A and viral proteins. To date, Rencofilstat have shown excellent safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies. Furthermore, Rencofilstat has anti-steatosis, anti-inflammation, anti-fibrotic and anti-tumor activity.<br><br> Link for full story: <a class="link" href="https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2020.9467" target="_blank">Click Here</a></div><br>
